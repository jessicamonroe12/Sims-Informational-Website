	<h1>Weclome!</h1>
  		<p>Hello! If you're looking for information on The Sims Freeplay then you have come to the right place! You can also find posts about The Sims Mobile here. I've been playing sims since 2012. Let's start with the basic's by going over the life stages of a Sim and what they need in order to thrive </p>
	<h2>Life Stages</h2>
		<p>When you first start the game you create an adult sim and begin the Tutorial. As you progress through the game you will unlock more Life Stages. Each life stage is unlocked by completing a main quest:</p>
		<p>Babies: complete the <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.blog/2014/02/12/the-sims-freeplay-two-and-a-half-sims-quest/">Two and a Half Sims Quest</a> to unlock</p>
		<p>Toddlers: complete <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.blog/2014/02/24/the-sims-freeplay-a-quest-for-toddlers/">A Quest for Toddlers</a> to unlock</p>
		<p>Preteens: complete the <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.blog/2014/03/26/the-sims-freeplay-preparing-for-preteens-quest/">Preparing for Preteens Quest</a> to unlock</p>
		<p>Teenagers: complete the <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.blog/2014/09/30/the-sims-freeplay-teenagers-quest/">Teenagers Quest</a> to unlock</p>
		<p>Aging your Teenagers to Adults: complete the <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.blog/2014/01/23/the-sims-freeplay-adulthood-quest/">Adulthood Quest</a> to unlock</p>
  <p>Seniors: complete the <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.blog/2014/01/28/the-sims-freeplay-seniors-quest/">Seniors Quest</a> to unlock</p>
  <p>—</p>
  <p><em><strong>Why can't I complete A Quest for Toddlers yet?</strong> </em>All <strong>main quests</strong> have to be complete in the order found in this post so you will not be able to do the Quest for Toddlers until all previous quests have been completed.</p>
	<h2> Sim Needs</h2>
  <p>Your sims have 6 needs that have to be fulfilled (the bar needs to be fully green) so they are satisfied, if they aren’t happy they mope around and take ages to walk anywhere and they won’t go to work. If you fill up all their needs almost completely (they will be inspired, being inspired is great because they earn more money and experience points when gardening and baking but also when they complete any action they will earn more XPs!)</p>
	<img src="../images/sim_needs.png" alt="sim needs" class="center">
		<ol>
		  <li>Hunger- fridge/ plate of food</li>
		  <li>Bladder- toilet</li>
		  <li>Energy- bed/ coffee machine</li>
		  <li>Hygiene- sink/shower/bath</li>
		  <li>Social- phone/interaction with a sim or pet</li>
		  <li>Fun- several things such as watch TV, check emails (but for adults and seniors I plant bell peppers)</li>
  </ol>
	
  <p>TIP: the same symbol that appears on your sims need bar also shows in the store so you know that item will fulfil that need</p>
  <p>To inspire a sim you need to fulfil at least 4 needs fully and for the other 2 most of the bar will need to be full.</p>
  <p>You can inspire a sim instantly with:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>A cupcake: this costs LPs, I wouldn't recommend this option!</li>
		  <li>Rainbow cakes: if you have this VIP Perk</li>
		  <li>Singing salmon: if you unlock this prize when completing the Life Dreams and Legacies Quest</li>
  		</ul>
	<p><em>How can I tell if my Sim is inspired?</em> Your Sim will begin to sparkle once they become inspired.</p>
