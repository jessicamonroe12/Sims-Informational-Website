	<h1>Beginners Guide</h1>
		<p class="p">When you first start the game there aren&rsquo;t many instructions as to what you need to do and how the game works so I have put together this guide to help you get the most out of the game!</p>
	<h2>Player Information Panel</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/player_information.jpg" alt="player information" width="251" height="251" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50" class="imgRight">At the top of your screen you will see a panel, this shows you your progress in the game:</p>
	  	<p>1.<strong>Level and XPs</strong>: This shows you your level and how far away you are from levelling up, if you click on this you will see how many more experience points you need to be able to level up</p>
		<p>2.<strong>VIP level</strong>: You earn VIP points when you buy items from the online store, the more you buy the higher your VIP level will be and the more <strong>VIP perks</strong> you will earn</p>
	  	<p>3.<strong>Simoleons</strong>: This is your main currency in the game, click on the green simoleon symbol to buy more with real money</p>
	  	<p>4.<strong>Lifestyle Points</strong>: This is a special currency, you can buy premium items with LPs or use them to <strong>speed up actions</strong>, again click on the orange LP symbol to buy more with real money</p>
		<p>5.<strong>Social Points</strong>: This is another special currency, you earn these by completing <strong>social tasks </strong>at neighbours houses or as rewards during <strong>live events and community events</strong></p>
		<p>6.<strong>Town Value and Sim Count</strong>: Click on this button to see your simtown information including your sim count (how many sims you currently have in your town/ how many you are allowed to add currently, this increases when you level up) as well as your town value, whenever you build a house, workplace or business or buy an item this adds to your town value, as your town value increases so does your <strong>daily simoleon reward</strong></p>
		<p>—</p>
	  	<p><em><strong>What is the time in the game?</strong></em> The time is the same as the time is for you so if its 10pm in your location then it will also be 10pm for your sims</p>
	<h2>Sim Information Panel</h2>
		<img src="../images/simdex_1.jpg" alt="simdex" width="358" height="358" class="imgLeft">
		<p><em>Your sim info panel will look different depending on the device you are playing on, on a larger device it will be a pop up tab at the bottom of the screen (shown as 1 in image above) and on a smaller device it will be in a folder on the side of your screen (shown as 2 in image above) with the simtracker included.</em></p>
		<p>(3)<strong> Careers and Education</strong>: This is where you can give your sims a job, enrol them at school, send them to work or school or quit their job </p>
		<p>(4) <strong>Hobbies</strong>: Here you can see all your sims hobbies and what level they are currently on in that hobby, click on the picture of the hobby to open up the hobby collection so you can see how many pieces they still need to collect before you will earn a reward:</p> 
		<p><img src="../images/sims_hobbies.jpeg" alt="sims hobbie panel" class="center"></p>
		<p>(5) <strong>Relationships</strong>: Relationships for the sim you are currently playing as.(6) <strong>Life Dreams</strong>: complete the <em>Life Dreams and Legacies</em> quest to get this tab. You will then be able to give your sims a life dream from here or see how far they have progressed with a life dream so far:</p>

	  <p>(7)<strong> Age Control</strong>: complete the <em>Life Dreams and Legacies</em> quest to get this tab. This tab allows you to advance, reverse or pause a sims age.</p>
	<h2> Sim Tracker</h2>
		<img src="../images/sim_tracker.jpeg" alt="sim tracker" width="360" class="imgRight">
	  <p><em>Your simtracker will look different depending on the device you are playing on, on a larger device it will be a pop up tab on the sims needs bar (shown as 1 in the image above) and on a smaller device it will be in a folder on the side of your screen (2)</em></p>
		<p>On the simtracker you can see the tasks your sims are currently doing (3) and if they have completed that action their face will flash with an XP symbol (4)</p>
		<p>The simtracker is also used to send sims to work (click on the pulsing suitcase (5), bring a sim to the location you are currently at (using the whistle(6) and sending a sim home (click on the house with the arrow inside it button(7)
