		<h1>Sim Currency</h1>
		<p>What are Simoleons? Lifestyle points? and Social Points? Well that's  currency used inside the Sims order to purchase fun items like clothes, houses, furniture. The Sims Freeplay currently has three types of currency: <strong>Simoleons, Lifestyle Points (LP), and Social Points (SP)</strong>. There are various ways to earn Simoleons in the game, including sending Sims to work, gardening, and baking.</p>
		<h2>Simoleons</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/simoleons.jpeg" alt="player information" width="140" height="210" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50" class="imgRight">Simoleons are the main currency used in The Sims FreePlay and other Sims games. It is represented with a section sign (§). Sims can earn money by cooking, working, their pet(s) finding it, gardening or collecting revenue from the town map. One can use them to buy furniture, houses, cars and shops. They can also buy Simoleon packs from the Online Store. Simoleons are the official currency of SimNation which is used in all games in The Sims Series. If players leave their game for a week or longer, when they return, they will receive free Simoleons (amount varies). The maximum amount of Simoleons one can have is §100,000,000.</p> <p>After they reach the limit, they cannot purchase any Simoleon packs with real money. Weekly Tasks always gives 5000 (one 2000 and one 3000) as benchmark rewards per week. Check Current Events incase of special events for some Simoleons.</p>
		<h2>Lifestyle Points</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/lifestyle_points.png" alt="player information" width="140" height="210" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50">Lifestyle Points (LP) are a type of currency used to buy premium items and to speed up actions. They can be earned, dug up, bought in the store for real money, or by watching videos and "viewing offers". Lifestyle Points are similar to Lifetime wishes in The Sims. Players can earn LP by doing hobbies that give players 1 LP each time a Sim reaches level 6 in the hobby. Completing a hobby continuously can give players a lot of Lifestyle Points (e.g. By completing the Cooking Hobby, it gives you 5 LP. Using many sims as possible for this hobby will help complete the Cooking Hobby more faster). Some hobbies have either 2, 3, 5 or 6 LP. </p>
		<p>The Cooking Hobby is one of the best ways to earn LP. The more sims you use for this hobby, the faster it is for you to complete its collection. It takes approximately about 10-15 minutes to complete it. </p>
		<p>Players can also earn LP through planting a Life Point Lotus that costs real money (depending on the player's country and the amount needed) with the Jackpot being 500 LP. (The "<a href="https://thegirlwhogames.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/the-sims-freeplay-money-grows-on-trees-quest/" title="Money Grows On Trees?">Money Grows On Trees?</a>" quest must be completed in order to unlock this).</p>
	  <p>Players can buy them through the Online Store with real money. In some updates, the LPs earned from hobbies sometimes decreases (for example, the Chocolatier Hobby previously had 3 LP when it first appeared in the 2016 Easter Update, but in later updates it dropped to 2 LP). </p>
	  <p>The last major way to get these is through town worth/level. Each level or town worth increase to hit a point would award some LP.	  </p>
	  <h2>Social Points</h2>
		<p><img src="../images/Social_Points.jpeg" alt="player information" width="140" height="210" align="left" hspace="50" vspace="50" class="imgRight"><strong>Social Points (SP)</strong> are a type of currency that became available after the <a href="https://simsfreeplay.fandom.com/wiki/Freeplay_Neighbours_update_2013" title="Freeplay Neighbours update 2013">Neighbours Update</a> was installed. They're similar to Lifestyle Points, but are purple in colour instead.</p><p>You can spend Social Points in the home store and online store. Anything that costs SP in the home store has a purple diamond like shape in the top left corner. Previously, the Nightclub costed 15 SP to build but as of the Grand Garages update (2019) you'll receive it for free when you start.During live events, you can use SP to speed up tasks. For normal tasks you would use Lifestyle Points.</p><p>You can earn social points by visiting another player's town and completing social task.</p><p>You may have a chance of earning SP by watching ads. This is not reliable since you can earn other items (Lifestyle Points, Furniture, Simoleons etc). </p><p>After the completion of the <a href="https://thegirlwhogames.wordpress.com/2014/02/12/the-sims-freeplay-money-grows-on-trees-quest/">Money Grows On Trees?</a> quest, you can plant the Social Point Flower. Which costs 20 LP (previously 5) . The amount of SP varies depending on the result of your roll. Once you reach VIP level 8, you can earn one free daily Social Point Flower.</p><p>You can also purchase Social Points pack via the online store using your real money.</p>
